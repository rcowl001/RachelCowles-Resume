        <p class="lead mb-4">At the end of middle school, I began volunteering at a summer camp as a Junior Counselor. Junior Counselors jobs are to help the counselors take care of the children that are assigned to their group throughout the day. My role was especially important because the counselors could not always keep track of so many kids by themselves. I helped them when they got hurt or when they needed to go to the bathroom, I was given a lot of responsibility in this job. Even though I was getting paid and it was volunteer work it was still a job to me. It was my first experience in ever having something that was like a job and I learned a lot from it. I learned how to communicate with others older than me in a professional manner, I also learned how to be responsible especially when dealing with something as important as a child, and I also learned leadership skills because often I had to take initiation of the group. I did this for several years learning more and more each summer. This was a very helpful experience for me in starting towards the eventuality of a job.<br><br>

        My next experience in a job like setting was my internship at the Greater San Fernando Valley Chamber of Commerce. In my senior year of high school, we had the requirement of an internship. We were all paired up and designated a specific internship to work at. The chamber of commerce was my first introduction to working in an office setting. I was given many responsibilities when it came to their events and members. Often, I would spend my whole time there that day calling each of the members and asking them important questions concerning events that were going on. I also helped set up the arrangements for them like nametags and raffle. I also had the responsibility of putting together and mailing out invoices along with filing and organizing the office. This taught me a lot about the office environment and what kind of skills you need to succeed in it. <br><br>

        My first paying job that I got was at cold stones, an ice cream shop in a shopping center. Here I worked with costumers all day while also keeping the store in order with my fellow employees. We cleaned dishes, cleaned the store, made cakes and cake orders, helped serve customers, along with many other things. This was a remarkably busy job and you were always on your feet doing something. In this job I learned a lot about communicated with customers along with being able to memorize the menu and remember everything your customer said if the order was customized. I learned how to work fast when crowds came in during the hot summer. I also learned how to manage my time and divide it between all of the things I had to do during that day. I gained a lot of experience and skills from all three of these jobs as I was put in different settings for each of them.
